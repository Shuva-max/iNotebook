# iNotebook

## Project Description

iNotebook is a web application that allows users to manage and store their notes in the cloud. It is a static web app built using React and styled with Bootstrap 5. Users can register and log in, and once authenticated, they can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their own notes. Additionally, the app provides dynamic alert notifications based on the server's response to user actions.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can create an account or log in to their existing account securely.

- **Note Management:** Users can create, view, edit, and delete their notes, ensuring they have full control over their content.

- **Cloud Storage:** All notes are stored in the cloud, making them accessible from any device with an internet connection.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed with Bootstrap 5 to ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

- **Dynamic Alerts:** Users will receive real-time alerts and notifications based on their interactions with the application and the server's responses.


## Technologies Used

- React: The front-end is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Bootstrap 5: The app's design and layout are styled with Bootstrap 5, making it visually appealing and responsive.
- Node.js and Express (Back-end): While not mentioned in the description, a server-side component may be used for user authentication and managing user data on the server.
- RESTful API: Likely used for communication between the front-end and back-end components.
